# Battle Billiard Galactic Edition

This repository contains the [Godot engine](https://godotengine.org/) project files for my Ludum Dare #42 entry.
Ludum Dare is a game jam - a contest where you aim to design and develop a game prototype over the course of a weekend.

A GIF showing the game in action, play instructions as well as a playable web build can be found at:
